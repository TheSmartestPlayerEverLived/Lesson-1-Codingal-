        <h1>My First Hobby: Cricket</h1>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport played by two teams of 11 players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The
        objective is to score more runs than the opposing team. A team scores runs by hitting the ball and running between a set
        of three wooden stumps, called wickets, located at each end of a central pitch. The fielding team tries to get batters
        "out" in various ways to limit the runs scored.</p>

      <h1>My Second Hobby: Tennis</h1>
        <p> Tennis is a racket sport played between two players (singles) or two teams of two (doubles) on a rectangular court
        divided by a net. Players use rackets to hit a ball over the net into the opponent's court, scoring a point when the
        opponent fails to make a valid return. The modern game originated in England in the late 19th century, and professional
        tournaments, like the four Grand Slams, are organized globally by governing bodies such as the International Tennis Federation.

        <h1>My Third Hobby: Badminton</h1>
        <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played with a shuttlecock over a net, either in singles (1) vs. (1)or doubles (2)
        vs. (2). The goal is to hit the shuttlecock so that the opponent cannot return it legally, scoring points by landing
        it in their court. The first player or pair to win two sets, with each set going to \(21\) points, wins the match.</p>
